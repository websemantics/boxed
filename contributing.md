## Pull Request Guidelines

* Please check to make sure that there aren't existing pull requests attempting to address the issue mentioned.
* Non-trivial changes should be discussed in an issue first.
* Develop in a topic branch, not master.
* Squash your commits.
* Write a convincing description of your PR and why we should land it
* Check the individual project to see if there is a **contributing.md** or similar file as some project's have different requirements.
