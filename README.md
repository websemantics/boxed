## Overview

Boxed is a lightweight Boilerplate Generator that does not require the Command-line Interface (CLI) to customize software addons and packages, for the Visually-oriented Developers.

Boxed can help you provide customizable Software Packages of your platform (modules, addons, extensions etc) to other developers in a visually appealing way, no more command line!

This porject has been developed as a proof of concept and I would welcome anyone's help to improve on it. Thank you!
